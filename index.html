                    <h2>I am a <span class="accent_text">Developer</span></h2>
                    <p>Well, kinda. I am a student, i am currently taking a course, where i learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python.<br>And it is <strong>exiting </strong>,i always wanted to learn myself some programming languages, just because i though that it was really cool and interesting, but i never had the time or effort to actually learn it.</p>
                    <h1>How i started</h1>
                    <p>At the time i really did not have any direction, i was unsure if i should study, or continue working, and then i got an offer to start taking programming courses at Jobloop, at first i was unsure, because i was never good at design, and making a website is all about the design.</p>
                    <p>But i thought why not, and gave it a shot, and immediately got hooked, i all of the sudden knew what i wanted to work as. I wanted work as a <strong>developer</strong>, programming is so much fun, there are so many different languages, it honestly is mind-blowing.</p>
                    <h1>Making progress</h1>
                    <p>I am making good progress, there are just so many things to learn that sometimes it gets overwhelming, but thats part of the fun, learning new things.</p>
                    <p>Even when making this website, i learned so many new things, and there are so many more things that i want to learn, i am really exited for the future, and becoming a full-time <strong>Developer</strong></p>
